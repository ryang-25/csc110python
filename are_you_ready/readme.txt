DESCRIPTION: 
HONOR CODE: On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized help on this assignment.
HOWTO: python3 prepared.py
INPUT FILE: prepared.py
OUTPUT FILE: N/A

COMMENTS: Invalid input raises an exception. I also completed the bonus parts.
REFLECTION: It took me roughly a class period to complete the assignment. I was
bored so I did the assignment in both python and haskell. The project is
straightforward by reading input from standard input and converting it to an
integer. By artificially constraining the inputs to make the hours needed to
excel nonzero I am able to avoid divide-by-zero.
