COMMENTS: I removed the dashes and added the digits together with a for loop.
For the calculation of the check digit I just did mod 11.
REFLECTION: It was straightforward but I didn't like how it mixed the checksum
with the check digit, since the checksum function was supposed to return the
check digit...
