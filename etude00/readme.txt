COURSE TITLE: CSC I: PythonForSci-E
MEETING TIME(S): 3 PM T,Th,F
DESCRIPTION: 
HONOR CODE: On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized help on this assignment.
HOWTO: python3 part1.py; python3 part2.py
INPUT FILE: part1.py, part2.py
OUTPUT FILE: N/A
BIBLIOGRAPHY: N/A
RESOURCES: N/A
TUTORS: N/A
COMMENTS: assumes that the input is well-formed. Callers must uphold the number invariants.
REFLECTION: It took me less than thirty minutes to complete the assignment. For
the first part, I used the common prefix and suffix of the prompt to save some
bytes and perform type conversion in one place, and used the fact that the
round function could be used to round the ouput to 2 decimal places. For the
second part, I used the fact that each arithmetic expression was the same as in
python, so I constructed and printed the expression, as well as the result of
evaluating that expression with eval.
