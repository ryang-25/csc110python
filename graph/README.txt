REFLECTION: Was fairly straightforward and did not take that much time. I reused
much of the old code from the previous assignment. I didn't feel like reading
the instructions on how to graph all the points in graphics.py so I just output
the binary P6 that graphics.py could read. The only thing that took a little
time was the fourth one and that was because it was math intensive, but it still
only took about half an hour or so. I also didn't want to use a string to
manipulate bits, so that was really easy.
